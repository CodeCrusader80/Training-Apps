<h1>üë®‚Äçüíª This repository includes some applications created in SwiftUI</h1>

<p>They are intended for those who would like to practice application design in this Apple framework. They are therefore quite simple but highlight certain key concepts necessary for the creation of more ambitious projects. If you need more animations, I have a repository for that as well.</p>

<h3>üåç PlanetShow</h3>
<hr>
<p>It is a small application containing a struct associated with a class and which makes it possible to manage information related to planets of our solar system. The advantage of this application is that it allows to better understand how the data flow occurs in SwiftUI in particular with ObservableObject. Unfortunately for English speakers, as I am French, the content text concerning the various planets has remained in French for the next ones, I will make you a little special version.</p>

<h3>ü§ò Chi-Fou-Mi</h3>
<hr>
<p>The legendary chi-fu-mi game which of course allows you to measure yourself against the computer. For once it's a timer that manages the choice of the computer so as to pass in the array containing the images that it is possible to select. For the choice of the player, this is done by a dialog box attached to the button which will then trigger an alert pausing the timer and allowing the display of the result of the round. The score only displays the player's score but it would be easy to add the score from the computer.</p>

<h3>üë©‚Äçü¶∞ Little Social</h3>
<hr>
<p>A small application that allows a profile page type view of a person. The latter has a profile photo, a number of subscribers, accounts followed etc... (all this being of course fixed for the moment, but can be developed to follow a real activity of a user on a network). There is also a side scrollview allowing you to select several types of content (again not functional). Then a grid of some content with photos. When clicking on an image, the latter is displayed in full page with a small insert indicating the number of likes, comments, a fictitious and randomly generated publication date as well as a description. All images and content are purely fictional, generated via MidJourney for artwork, my mind and a random name generator</p>
