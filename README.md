<h1>👨‍💻 This repository includes some applications created in SwiftUI</h1>

<p>They are intended for those who would like to practice application design in this Apple framework. They are therefore quite simple but highlight certain key concepts necessary for the creation of more ambitious projects. If you need more animations, I have a repository for that as well.</p>

<h3>🌍 PlanetShow</h3>
<hr>
<p>It is a small application containing a struct associated with a class and which makes it possible to manage information related to planets of our solar system. The advantage of this application is that it allows to better understand how the data flow occurs in SwiftUI in particular with ObservableObject. Unfortunately for English speakers, as I am French, the content text concerning the various planets has remained in French for the next ones, I will make you a little special version.</p>
